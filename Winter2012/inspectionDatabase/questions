NULL and not null constraints?
1) Blobs (do we need extensions)
2) whether the number of tuples constraints in relationships is used to decide the kind of data entered, or can we specify that when creating tables
3) In relational we cannot explicitly specify the constraints / relationships between entities? 
4) Windows forms is front end , then how do we access the database? because we now have only Java and Python clients
5) In tag table, we have to enter the location of the tag. How does the user enter the tag? shud we store it as pixels or something else?
6) We update it separately, Gwen should be sent the changed schema?
