you just need to be able to compile libidx

for the model used by the sparse idxs, see spIdx.h

/!\ Some of eblearn has been re-implemented for spIdx, such as 
state_spidx, some neural modules and a trainer.
However it wasn't advanced enough to create a new spEblearn library.
These structure are available in the sp_doc_classifier project, in the
demo projects.
