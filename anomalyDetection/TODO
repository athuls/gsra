Implementation TODO's:
1) Use constraint learning to accept data in form of non-specific constraints (approximate model), and use regression to get the exact model
2) Programmatically provide constraints
3) Currently batch. Need to convert to incremental
4) Think about using distances between consecutive readings along attributes (like time) to determine the signalling of an event
