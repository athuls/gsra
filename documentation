1) All the relevant startup scripts for Senstore Server are at the following path -
   /opt/scripts

2) When the system boots, scripts are run in the following order : 

   a) script_check_postgres.sh - waits until Postgres server starts, and then the script exits.
   b) script_ufw_block.sh - Blocks port 10004 and prevents it from accepting external connections (thus allowing the restore script to run)
   c) script_start_senstore.sh - Runs the Senstore start and restore scripts, using the most recent backup file available at /opt/senstore/release/senstore. 
   d) script_ufw_allow.sh - Opens port 10004, to start listening to external connections, after the restore script completes.

3) The above sequence is enforced using Upstart, which is event based. The relevant config files for the same can be found at : 
   /etc/init

   And the relevant configuration files are -
   1) upstart-senstore.conf 
   2) upstart-ufw_block.conf
   3) upstart-start_senstore.conf
   4) upstart-ufw_allow.conf

   Also details about Upstart and its working can be found at - http://upstart.ubuntu.com/getting-started.html


Backup scripts:

Location : /opt/senstore/release/senstore
Relevant files: 
1) senstore_backup_script.sh - Blocks port 10004, to prevent Senstore from accepting external connections, and runs senstore_backup.pl 
2) senstore_backup.pl - Attempts backup of data in 'telegraph' database. The backup is attempted till it succeeds or a maximum of three times (whichever comes first). If it succeeds in any of the attempts, it immediately exits. Else it mails the pantherserver1 Gmail account, about the time of failure of backup attempt, along with the output and error files attached. Before exiting, it opens up port 10004 of Senstore. 
3) senstore_backup_trim.sh - Script to run scshm_backup_trim.py, which removes old backup files, except for the last one of every previous day and all the backup files of the most recent day when a successful backup was made. 

There are 2 cronjobs running currently:
1) senstore_backup_script.sh - once every 6 hours
2) senstore_backup_trim.sh - once every week
To modify the cronjob, type 
$ crontab -e
when you are logged in as root. 

Note: We must ensure both the backup and trim jobs do not run simultaneously, because only one job can be run at a time (need to fix it).
