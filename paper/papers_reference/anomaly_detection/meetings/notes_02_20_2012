1) Client application : Basic functionality + working on additional features
2) Running experiments on error analysis (context aware framework)
3) Anomaly : 
a) Complete coverage : output results on priority
b) Sort within same coverage sets : 
   (i) we can pick the variables having maximum impact on the constraints
       But what if constraint values are such that lower impact variables are the cause for current anomaly. 
       Therefore we need to look into the values of satisfaction degrees of constraints for the anomalous data, and then decide on which variables are culprits
       Can look at the variable's impact in terms of unit change in constraint satisfaction with unit change in variable value. But we will need to define reference constraint satisfaction degrees!!
c) Also working on math to validate the above steps
